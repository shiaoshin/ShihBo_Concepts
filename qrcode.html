                        This work aims to discuss the unreliability of languages. We human beings created alphabets in order to record our thoughts. People of different cultures write in different languages even though their ideas are the same. One way we communicate is by translation. Without translation, many thoughts and ideas can not be understood. I doubt if people can really understand what people think in other languages? I transferred 26 English alphabets into QR Codes, and then removed the common part of the codes. The rest of them were regarded as a kind of alphabets. Each of them indeed stands for one alphabet, but we can not understand at all. Only if we combine them with the common part and then scan them by a smartphone can we get the meanings.
